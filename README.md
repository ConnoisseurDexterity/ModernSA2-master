# Modern Sonic Adventure 2 v6 - Source Code
### Finally, the code for this mod is up on the hub.



## Why?
To make it easy to collaborate and work on the code. I'm new to programming, so I can't add what experienced programmers can add and do things how they do it. This will benefit any of us working on this/helping with code implementation for MSA2.

## What do you actually do with code?
I work on the nitty gritty details of sound, keyframes and animation code so characters in MSA2 all sound unique and animate a little better. I also merge some code here and there. That's pretty much it lol.

Hoppy works on all the saucy stuff that makes this mod fantastic!
