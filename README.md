# Modern Sonic Adventure 2 v6 - Source Code
### Finally, the code for this mod is up on the hub.

To make it easy to collaborate and work on the code. I'm new to programming, so I can't add what experienced programmers can add and do things how they do it. This will benefit any of us working on this/helping with code implementation for MSA2.
